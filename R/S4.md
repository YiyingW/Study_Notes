## S4
* methods belong to functions, not classes, but:
      * Classes have formal definitions which describe their fields and inheritance structures 
      * Method dispatch can be based on multiple arguments to a generic function, not just one
      * @ is for extracting slots (fields) from an S4 object
* to create a new class in S4, use the `setClass()` function. You need to specify two or three arguments, 
    * Class, the name of the class as a string
    * slots, a named list of attributes for the class with the class of those attributes specified, and 
    opitionally contains which includes the super-class of the class you're specifiying. 
    
* example
```
setClass("bus_S4",
         slots = list(n_seats = "numeric", 
                      top_speed = "numeric",
                      current_speed = "numeric",
                      brand = "character"))
setClass("party_bus_S4",
         slots = list(n_subwoofers = "numeric",
                      smoke_machine_on = "logical"),
         contains = "bus_S4")
```
* to create bus objects, use the `new()` function. 
    * name of the class
    * values for each slot in S4 object
* example
```
my_bus <- new("bus_S4", n_seats = 20, top_speed = 80, 
              current_speed = 0, brand = "Volvo")

my_party_bus <- new("party_bus_S4", n_seats = 10, top_speed = 100,
                    current_speed = 0, brand = "Mercedes-Benz", 
                    n_subwoofers = 2, smoke_machine_on = FALSE)
```
* use the @ operator to access the slots of an S4 object
```
my_bus@n_seats
```
* S4 classes use a generic method system that is similar to S3 classes. To implement a new 
generic method, use the `setGeneric()` function and the `standardGeneric()` function. 
```
setGeneric("is_bus_moving", function(x){
  standardGeneric("is_bus_moving")
})
setMethod("is_bus_moving",
          c(x = "bus_S4"),
          function(x){
            x@current_speed > 0
          })
```
* In addition to creating your own generic methods, you can also create a method for your new class from an existing generic. First use the setGeneric() function with the name of the existing method you want to use with your class, and then use the setMethod() function like in the previous example. Letâ€™s make a print() method for the bus_S4 class:
```
setGeneric("print")
[1] "print"

setMethod("print",
          c(x = "bus_S4"),
          function(x){
            paste("This", x@brand, "bus is traveling at a speed of", x@current_speed)
          })
```
