## S4
* to create a new class in S4, use the `setClass()` function. You need to specify two or three arguments, 
    * Class, the name of the class as a string
    * slots, a named list of attributes for the class with the class of those attributes specified, and 
    opitionally contains which includes the super-class of the class you're specifiying. 
    
* example
```
setClass("bus_S4",
         slots = list(n_seats = "numeric", 
                      top_speed = "numeric",
                      current_speed = "numeric",
                      brand = "character"))
setClass("party_bus_S4",
         slots = list(n_subwoofers = "numeric",
                      smoke_machine_on = "logical"),
         contains = "bus_S4")
```
* to create bus objects, use the `new()` function. 
    * name of the class
    * values for each slot in S4 object
* example
```
my_bus <- new("bus_S4", n_seats = 20, top_speed = 80, 
              current_speed = 0, brand = "Volvo")

my_party_bus <- new("party_bus_S4", n_seats = 10, top_speed = 100,
                    current_speed = 0, brand = "Mercedes-Benz", 
                    n_subwoofers = 2, smoke_machine_on = FALSE)
```
* use the @ operator to access the slots of an S4 object
```
my_bus@n_seats
```
* S4 classes use a generic method system that is similar to S3 classes. To implement a new 
generic method, use the `setGeneric()` function and the `standardGeneric()` function.
