* Adjusted R^2
    * pairwise scatter plot for initial exploratory of data 
    * R^2 = (explained variability) / (total variability)
    * you can do anova analysis on a linear model to analyze variability partition 
    * adjusted R^2 penalizes the number of predictors put into the model, if the added variable is completely unrelated, the 
    adjusted R^2 doesn't increase. 
* Collinearity and parsimony
