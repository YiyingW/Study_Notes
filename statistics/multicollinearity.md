## common methods used for detecting multicollinearity
* the analysis exhibits the signs of multicollinearity -- estimates of the coefficients vary from model to model  
* the t-test for each of the individual slopes are non-significant but the overall F-test is significant  
* the correlations among pairs of predictor variables are large  
* variance inflation factors (VIF) 
    * the standard errors of the estimated coefficients are inflated when multicollinearity exists. we look at 
    VIF for each estimated coefficient. A VIF exists for each of the k predictors in a multiple regression model.
